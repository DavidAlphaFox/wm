* Goals
  Here is a set of goals for this window manager:

  - Common Lisp;
  - Just the features I want;
  - Simple and easy to maintain code;
  - No more than 500 SLOC;
  - No configuration outside the main program. Don't do anything fancy
    (text, icon, cursor or color) to avoid the temptation;
  - No [[http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html][EWMH]] as implementing this shit would bloat the code for little
    (if any) improvements.
* Help
** Install
   - Install [[http://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]] or [[http://www.clisp.org/][CLISP]] on your system (should be available via
     your system's packages);
   - Install [[http://www.quicklisp.org/][quicklisp]];
   - Tweak line 4 of wm.lisp to point to your quicklisp directory.
*** with SBCL
    Append =sbcl --script [your path to]/wm.lisp= to your .xinitrc or
    .xsession.
*** with CLISP
    Append =xhost local:local= and =clisp [your path to]/wm.lisp= to
     your .xinitrc or .xsession.
** Shortcuts
   =Control-t= is the prefix key. Every shortcut starts with it.
   - =n= or =C-n= is next managed window;
   - =p= or =C-p= is previous managed window;
   - =C-t= is last used window;
   - =t= sends a =C-t= to current window;
   - =c= runs a xterm;
   - =e= runs or raise an emacs;
   - =w= runs or raise a web browser (configurable in wm.lisp);
   - =C-l= locks the screen with xlock;
   - =a= is the app launcher: keys hit after will look for the correct
     app;
   - ='= is the class finder: works like the app launcher but fetch
     the first window of the given class;
   - =f= toggles the current window to fullscreen (and revert
     size/position when changing focus);
   - =.= centers the current window.
** Mouse
   =Meta= (or =Alt=) is the prefix for the mouse.
   - left button moves the window;
   - right button resize the window;
   - C-middle button close the window.
** Emacs
   With SBCL, one of the first thing that wm.lisp does is to create a
   swank server on port 4005. You can then connect Emacs/SLIME to it
   (M-x slime-connect) and hack the window manager live.
