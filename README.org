* Goals
  Here is a set of goals for this window manager:

  - Common Lisp;
  - Just the features I want;
  - Simple and easy to maintain code;
  - No more than 500 SLOC;
  - No configuration outside the main program. Don't do anything fancy
    (text, icon, cursor or color) to avoid the temptation.

* Help
** Install
   - Install sbcl ([[http://www.sbcl.org]]) on your system (should be
     available via your system's packages);
   - Install quicklisp ([[http://www.quicklisp.org]]);
   - Tweak line 5 of wm.lisp to point to your quicklisp directory;
   - Append "[your path to]/wm.lisp" to .xinitrc or .xsession.
** Shortcuts
   'Control-t' is the prefix key. Every shortcut starts with it.
   - 'n' or 'C-n' is next managed window;
   - 'p' or 'C-p' is previous managed window;
   - 'C-t' is last used window;
   - 't' sends a 'C-t' to current window;
   - 'c' runs a xterm;
   - 'e' runs or raise an emacs;
   - 'w' runs or raise a web browser (configurable in wm.lisp);
   - 'l' locks the screen with xlock;
   - 'a' is the app launcher: keys hit after will look for the correct
     app;
   - 'f' toggles the current window to fullscreen.
** Mouse
   'Meta' (or 'Alt') is the prefix for the mouse.
   - 'left button' moves the window;
   - 'right button' resize the window;
   - 'C-middle button' close the window.
** Emacs
   One of the first thing that wm.lisp does is to create a swank
   server on port 4005. You can then connect Emacs/SLIME to it (M-x
   slime-connect) and hack the window manager live.
